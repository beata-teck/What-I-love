<h2>About Books</h2>
<p>Books are my quiet refuge—soft-spined worlds where time slows and thoughts deepen. <br> I love the scent of old pages, the hush between chapters, and the way a single sentence can linger like a melody. <br>Whether it’s poetry, fiction, or folklore, I read not to escape, but to feel more deeply connected to everything.
